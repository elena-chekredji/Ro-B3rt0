# Autonomous Arduino Robot Car

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for an autonomous robot car engineered using Arduino, 
designed to perform various functionalities such as edge detection, object avoidance, line tracking, and fire extinguishing. 
The project integrates a variety of sensors and actuators, including infrared and ultrasonic sensors, DC motors, servos, and flame 
sensors, showcasing a comprehensive application of embedded systems principles. This robot car achieved the top grade in our class project, 
demonstrating excellent collaboration, problem-solving, and system design capabilities.

## Features

- **Edge Detection**: Utilizes infrared sensors to detect and avoid edges, preventing falls.
- **Object Avoidance**: Employs ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and navigate around them.
- **Line Tracking**: Follows a predefined path using visual markers with high precision.
- **Fire Extinguishing**: Detects and extinguishes small fires using a flame sensor and a small servo-controlled water jet.

## Technology Stack

- **Arduino**: Serves as the central processing unit for controlling various functions.
- **Infrared Sensors**: For edge detection and basic navigation.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: For distance measurement and obstacle avoidance.
- **DC Motors**: Provide the necessary mobility to the robot car.
- **Servos**: Used in the mechanism to aim and shoot water for fire extinguishing.
- **Flame Sensor**: Detects the presence of fire by sensing the heat.

## Collaboration

This project was a collaborative effort, developed by a dedicated team of students. We utilized agile
principles and held regular scrum meetings to ensure a seamless development process and effective problem-solving strategies.
